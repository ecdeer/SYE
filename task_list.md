## Task List

### For February 12

1. Change code so that they all have their individual fits and use Judith's data to compare. Combine with bind_rows() and then facet by location to compare.

2. Read 7.1 through 7.4.

3. MH: Send Emma regression MCMC algorithm.

### For February 5

1. Read Chapter 6 of Bayes Rules <https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/> (skim through the Stan parts, which we won't use).

2. Fit the growth curve to each (if AI can help map through or to some) of the locations and see if there is anything you notice comparing Lakes and Rivers.

### For January 29

0. remove negative growths (and keep track).

1. Fit the von Bertanfly curve to a few different clams in R (see resources).

2. Read Chapter 2.3 and 4.1 through 4.3 of Bayes Rules <https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/>.

### For January 22

1. Make growth curves for clams, faceting by site (so about 10 - 15 curves per subplot).

2. Read Chapter 1 and Chapter 2.1 of Bayes Rules <https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/>.
